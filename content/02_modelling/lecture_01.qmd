THIS PRESENTATION COULD NOT BE DONE WITHOUT OTHERS

- Part of the materials I present are developed by [Gerko Vink](https://www.gerkovink.com/) for the R summerschool course at Utrecht University. 

- Part of the materials I present are developed by [Rens van de Schoot](https://www.rensvandeschoot.com/) and collaborators as part of the tutorial section of his website.

# The Basics

## Let's get some data

Let's start with getting data and just inspecting it.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# get from datasets package the Orange data
data(Orange)
# print the fist rows
head(Orange)
``` 

# What do these variables mean? (if it's not clear)
